# Plant Care

I'm not good at remembering to water my plants. As such I wanted to make an app that notified me every time one of my plants needed watered. In this case you can input your plants and when you last watered it and it will let you know when you next need to water it. If you share your household with another, get them to download the app and add the household code, now you won't both water the plant on the same day.
